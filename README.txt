ToDoList Android application

This application is an To Do List application for keep track of list created by the user.
The user can create a new title for the new list and add items to the list.
There are validation checks such as empty checks, special characters, to ensure the names of
the list and the list items are valid.

I will eventually evolved this application to a full List Organization application.

In the main git folder, there is the classes and Documentation folder.
The classes folder contain the actually classes for the project.
The Documentation folder contain various documentation of the project
including a UML Diagram, Coding and Solution Document, etc.
